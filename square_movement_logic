Logic for Square movement

Moving for the 1st time
- Pick a random direction
- Run logic for border/collision detection
	- If unable to move in randomly chosen direction then "bounce" (attempt to move in the opposite direction)
	- If unable to move in the direction "bounced" in, then randomly choose another valid direction
- Move Square if possible and record direction last moved in



Moving after the 1st time
- First attempt to move in the direction last moved in
- Run logic for border/collision detection
	- If unable to move in chosen direction then "bounce" (attempt to move in the opposite direction)
	- If unable to move in the direction "bounced" in, then randomly choose another valid direction
- Move Square if possible and record direction last moved in
